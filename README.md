# Audio-Processing-Project
Utilizing libraries such as Pandas, PyDub, Matplotlib, NumPy, Librosa, and Tkinter, I processed and analyzed audio files to extract various features, including wavelength and frequency. This involved using Pandas for data manipulation, PyDub for audio processing, Matplotlib for visualization, NumPy for numerical operations, and Librosa for advanced audio analysis. Tkinter was employed to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the audio data.
